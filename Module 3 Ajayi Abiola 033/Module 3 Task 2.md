# BACKGROUND

Market penetration can be defined as either a measurement or an activity.

##### Market penetration defined as a measurement, 

is the assessment of how much a product is being sold relative to the total estimated market for that product, expressed as a percentage. 

Market penetration rate is calculated with this formula:

Market penetration rate = (number of customers ÷ target market size) X 100				

##### Market penetration defined as an activity

Market penetration defined as an activity is the process of going to market with a product in an existing market in which current or similar products already live, and taking market share from the other competing companies. This is also known as market penetration strategy.

Market penetration strategy is one of the four business growth strategies identified in the Ansoff Matrix, the other three being market development strategy, product development strategy, and diversification strategy. 

A market penetration strategy carries a low amount of risk, and is an ideal business growth strategy for SaaS startups that are bootstrapped or unwilling to invest heavily in more risky growth strategies.

Put simply, it’s a means of planning how to grow in an already thriving market where similar products exist, and gaining market share by taking your competitors’ subscribers.

Market penetration requires strong implementation and execution of strategies around product positioning, pricing, user experience, and marketing in order to compete and grow alongside existing companies.

### How to create a market penetration strategy

When thinking about creating a market penetration strategy and increasing market share, it is important to consider the different ways to grow the company using existing offerings to make it more appealing to the customers who exist in the target market.

#### Common market penetration strategies;


### Market penetration pricing

Pricing is one of the main tactics that emerging products use to gain market share and grow their revenue when using market penetration strategy. These adjustments can be easily measured to determine their level of success.

The following questions are to be asked depending on the product; did market share increase or decrease when pricing went from monthly to annual? How many new customers were acquired with the announcement of a new pricing plan? Would dropping the subscription prices work to take customers away from competitors?

### Increasing your marketing and promotional efforts

Here, changing tactics or becoming more aggressive with marketing campaigns can help to increase awareness in the market. This, in turn, can woo more of the competitors’ customers into switching and signing up for the product instead.

Marketing can also help persuade existing customers to stick with the product instead of leaving for the competition. Loyalty schemes, power user features, strategic alliances, and finding unique ways to deliver value to users can all help keep customers. If users have a stellar experience with the product, they’ll be more likely to help out with word of mouth marketing which can also drive an increase in market share.

### Acquisition and partnerships

Acquisition as a market penetration strategy is almost as old as business itself. Buying a company in the industry means essentially buying the customer base and the market share that it brings with it. In startup mode, acquisition is probably not the ballpark just yet. In this case, looking into strategic alliances with similar companies in order to capture their audience and widen the market would be best.

### Making changes to your product

Listening to customers, and keeping track of what competitors’ customers are saying about their products can help pinpoint essential features and functions that people are looking for.

A slight adjustment to the product could make all the difference in terms of the market penetration rate by giving the market something that they need and can’t find with any other company.

## HOW I WOULD INCREASE THE MARKET PENETRATION OF CHIPPER CASH APPLICATION

In order to increase the market penetration of Chipper cash application, I would use the following techniques
* Increase the number of countries where the product is being offered
* Utilize product-led growth strategy to improve the current metrics of the application.

#### 1.	Increase the number of countries where the product is being offered.

Currently, chipper Cash have over 4 million users and the service is only available in just 8 African countries and the US making a total of 9 countries. There is no doubt that one of the major ways to increase the market penetration of this product is to take the service to other countries where the service is currently not offered.  

#### 2.	Utilize Product-Led growth strategy to improve the current metrics of the application.

Product-led growth is a business methodology in which user acquisition, expansion, conversion, and retention are all driven primarily by the product itself.

Today, customer referrals and word-of-mouth have become the largest influence on the purchase process. Product-Led Growth, PLG, is a growth strategy that ensures that the necessary growth for the business is produced by the product itself.

The following steps are the Product-Led growth strategies I think should be done to further improve the product.

* Frictionless onboarding process: 

From the little analysis of the Chipper Cash application, I realize that the growth of the product is reduced due to the frictions that exist as soon as new users signed into the application. The verification process is slow and lacks different options. The time to value of the product is really high and I believe this impedes the acquisition, activation, retention and even the referral metrics of the product. In short, the application is not using the product lead strategy to grow the business. 

Noted problems include; slow verification process, lack of other verification options in the application. 

* Include in-app product tour: 

Product tours do the important job of introducing users to the product. When done well, they improve user experience, motivate users to take key actions, and shorten new users' time-to-value—improving activation, conversion, and retention rates.

* Prompt unverified acquired users to verify their account: 

Some acquired users have abandoned the application due to several reasons, one of which includes the verification hassle. Using the email prompts will encourage existing but dormant user to come back into the application to try the verification process again. However, I think this should be done after the verification process have been rectified.
