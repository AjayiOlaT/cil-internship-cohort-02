# CHIPPER CASH APPLICATION

Chipper Cash is a free mobile app that allows users to send money within and out of their home country in Africa. Users can also receive money from other countries by using Chipper Cash at a cheap currency conversion rate.

Though, it’s not as functional as PayPal and works in only 8 countries, Chipper Cash is still among the best Fintech companies in Africa. It is smooth and responsive to touch while also processing transactions at a fast rate.

Sending and receiving money in most African countries still has some setbacks. When sending money out of a country to another, there are usually glitches and system delays. But from the time Chipper Cash was launched, sending and receiving money became easier across Africa.

### How does Chipper Cash works

Chipper Cash works by allowing a window for transactions. On Chipper Cash, users can send money, receive money, and request money. It can be within or outside the users’ country of residence.

If users have a business transaction or patronage with someone outside the country, users won’t have to visit the bank.

All they need to do is to deposit the money into their Chipper Cash account and then send it to the recipient in the other country. On receiving the money, the recipient can withdraw to his/her bank account and the business deal is done.

No doubt that the app is a very user friendly product, however, as a user myself, I have some complains and some changes that I wish could be made to the features on the application. 

## Why do I want this features improved?

I think the product is really great, simple to use, user friendly and user oriented. However, despite these qualities, I believe the adjustments I want to suggest will be of great help to the product’s onboarding process and will also increase the user experience of the product. I think it will also help increase the confidence that users have in the product as well as the improve customer loyalty.

## FEATURES TO IMPROVE

#### HOME PAGE

The home page is the screen users get to immediately after successfully logging into the app. It contains features and buttons that help user quickly get the value that the product has to offer. However, the transaction histories carried out by users are also shown on the homepage which I find inappropriate. I remember trying to prevent an overbearing friend from seeing my previous transactions when logging into the application but there was no way for me to achieve this. I think there should be a separate page for the transaction history where users can securely access recent transactions done on the application.

##### Vision: 

This will help improve user experience on the application. It could also increase the product usage and product retention. Knowing fully well that no third party can see my previous transaction on my homepage will improve the number of time I use the product.

#### VERIFICATION OF NEW USERS

I believe that one of the selling points of the app is to mitigate the exorbitant fee charged by local banks when users are performing financial transaction. This application, at the moment of writing this report, only accept the bank verification number, BVN, at the point of verifying the users. I think this will limit the number of users that can enjoy the value that the product has to offer. Not the whole market population has BVN, but others could have other valid means of identification and I think this should be added to the verification step.

In addition to this, the referral scheme on the application is a good initiative; however, it is unfortunate that, users are not encouraged to refer other users to the application due to the slow verification of new users and limited means of verification.
Therefore, I think the verification process should be automated in other to reduce the number of users that install the app and never get to tap into its value.

##### Vision: 

The strategic vision behind this suggestion is to reduce the time-to-value of the product. Users should start enjoying the value a product has to offer in the smallest time possible and if this means skipping the verification step until a certain amount of money is to be transacted, or making the verification step easier and faster, then I think it should be done.

This will help increase the user retention metrics and also drive up user engagement of the application.

#### CASHOUT

This feature enables users to make a cash transfer from their wallet into their local bank account. First, I think the name should be changed to something like ‘Transfer’ because, I feel the current name misrepresent the true function of the feature.

On the same vein, the reward for using the cash out feature is not good enough. Currently, users only get a popup showing that the transaction has been successful. However, I think there should be a tangible reward for instance; there should be an e-receipt of the transaction downloadable onto the users’ devices. The e-receipt should clearly show the name and logo of the application and a short note that says something like ‘this transaction was done for free’, followed by a proper call to action with embedded link to download the application. Therefore, when a user forwards this e-receipt to a non-user, this will serve as a way for the product to sell itself to potential customers.

##### VISION: 

This will increase user’s confidence, user engagement, and user loyalty. It will also serve as a form of advertisement for the product.
