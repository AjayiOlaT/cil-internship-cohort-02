# LIST OF SOME OF THE FEATURES/SERVICES OF CHIPPER CASH
	
## Registration and Onboarding

To use Chipper Cash in Nigeria, a phone number is the basic requirement needed to create an account. User can also choose to use email address. Afterward, users have to input the verification code that was sent to the number or email. Another unique feature in Chipper Cash is that it lets users connect and sign in to their wallet/account with multiple numbers or email addresses. So, if a user lose their phone number, they can still access (and verify) Chipper Cash with the secondary numbers or email addresses.

## Account Verification and Transfer Limits

A newly-registered user can receive unlimited amount of money from anyone, anywhere. However, they will only be able to send a maximum of Four Million Naira (N 4,000,000) and Twenty Million Naira (N20,000,000). For withdrawals, new users can only cash-out Twenty thousand naira (N20,000) daily.

To increase this withdrawal limit, users have to verify their identity. To do this, a Nigerian user will be required to provide their Bank Verification Number (BVN) and take a selfie. Chipper Cash will verify the information provided and raise the transaction limits accordingly. 

## Funding Wallet

At the moment, Nigerian users can only fund their Chipper Cash wallet via card payments. 

## Sending Money

Chipper Cash lets users send money to other registered Chipper Cash users on their phonebook. Users can also send money to their contacts that aren’t registered on Chipper Cash. The recipient will be prompted (via SMS) to create a Chipper Cash account to receive the funds. If the recipient doesn’t register an account to claim the payment, the money will be refunded to you.

## Bill Payments

As earlier mentioned, Chipper Cash lets users pay internet, electricity, and TV bills. Users get a 2% discount on every airtime purchase. 

## Withdrawal
Like bill payments, airtime purchase, and other services on Chipper Cash, withdrawing funds on the platform is also free. For Nigerian users, they can only withdraw funds from their Chipper Wallet to their bank account. 

## Auxiliary Bank Account

As an added perk, Chipper Cash users also get a bank account (powered by WEMA Bank). This account (dubbed the “Chipper Account Number”) works just like regular bank account; people can send money into the account number from their banks and banking apps. The funds will be deposited directly to the Chipper Wallet.

## Money Request

If users are out of money, or perhaps someone owes the user, the ‘Request’ feature of the Chipper Cash app lets users request money from their contact list or other Chipper Cash users.

## Security & Privacy

Chipper Cash has some measures in place to help safeguard your account and funds. As earlier mentioned, whenever you sign out of the Chipper Cash app, you will be required to go through Two-Step Authentication (via SMS) before you can log back into your account.

The app also has a Security Lock feature that will prompt you to enter your Chipper PIN each time you close the app. This is an added layer of security that will prevent anyone who has access to your device from opening your Chipper Cash dashboard without your authorization. You could toggle on the ‘Hide Balance’ to conceal your balance from the home screen.
