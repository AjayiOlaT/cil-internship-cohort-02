Also the download attribution of the app is included. That is, the channels the new users come from. This data can be used to optimize marketing spend and improve ROI.

Comparing daily uninstalls with the number of daily downloads and daily activations gives the net result of the app growth.

## PREFERRED TOOL TO USE FOR THE PRODUCT MATRICS

There are several tools out there which can be used for measuring various application matrices. This tools range from paid to free. Having said this, my preferred tool for this application will be Google analytics. This is because the app is from Google and I trust them. In addition, the tool is free to use with comes in handy. 

Another tool that caught my fancy is Mixpanel. It is not completely free, I think some of the important features will only be available to paid subscribers; therefore it will not be my number one choice.

Thanks.
